Hey there! Starting a new JS/TS package?

Whether it's a library, a plugin, an integration, a CLI, or anything else in the world:

-   Write it in TypeScript for best reliability and development experience.
-   Use the battle-tested Yarn for dependency management.
-   Test quickly and easily with Jest (plus `ts-jest` for TypeScript support).
-   Adhere to PostHog Style™️ by formatting code with Prettier and ensuring best practices with ESLint
    – or actually, don't do it: let pre-commit hooks handle this for you.

Start out using this template and hit the ground quickly with all of the above from the get-go.

## Get on with it

1. Update fields `name`, `description`, `keywords`, `respository`, `bugs` and `homepage` in `package.json`.
2. Make sure tha you have Yarn installed and run `yarn` to install dependencies.  
   Note: file `yarn.lock` will be created. Commit this.
3. Write your package, starting with `src/index.ts`!
