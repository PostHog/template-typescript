> Hey there! Starting a new JS/TS package?
>
> Whether it's a library, a plugin, an integration, a CLI, or anything else in the world:
>
> -   Write it in TypeScript for best reliability and development experience.
> -   Use the battle-tested Yarn for dependency management.
> -   Test quickly and easily with Jest (plus `ts-jest` for TypeScript support).
> -   Adhere to PostHog Style™️ by formatting code with Prettier and ensuring best practices with ESLint
>     – or actually, don't do it: let pre-commit hooks handle this for you.
> -   Have GitHub Actions run all of the above when working on pull requests. Plus have them take care of publishing releases on npm and GitHub whenever the version is incremented.
>
> Start out using this template and hit the ground quickly with all of the above from the get-go.
>
> ## Get on with it
>
> 1. Update fields `name`, `description`, `keywords`, `respository`, `bugs` and `homepage` in `package.json`.
> 2. Make sure that you have Yarn installed and run `yarn` to install dependencies.  
>    Note: file `yarn.lock` will be created. Commit this.
> 3. Write your package, starting with `src/index.ts`!
>
> _When publishing on GitHub, add an automation-type npm access token as GitHub secret `NPM_TOKEN` in order for auto-release to work._

_Now, erase the notes above and fill this README with something actually relevant! Don't forget to update the npm badge too._
